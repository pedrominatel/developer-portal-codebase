# Developer Portal Codebase

## Description
**developer-portal-codebase** is an extension of the [Espressif Developer Portal](https://github.com/espressif/developer-portal).  
This repository hosts source code used in **articles, workshops, examples, demos, and tests** that support ESP-IDF content published on the developer portal.

It is **not** intended for the Hugo-based website code — instead, it serves as the technical foundation for code examples, educational materials, and developer resources shared on [developer.espressif.com](https://developer.espressif.com).
